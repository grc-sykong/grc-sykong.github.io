            <main class="about">
                <p>Konglish was established in 2022. We are a business that strives to introduce Korean culture and cuisine to America and hopes to spread cultural awareness and acceptance through food. Our passion for food stems from growing up with both Korean and American cuisines and finding that cooking and food brings people of all races, genders, and ages together. We hope to continue growing as a family and we invite you to join us! Our owner Sydney Kong decided to name this place Konglish as it represents here upbringing, with Korean traditions, but an American lifestyle.</p>
